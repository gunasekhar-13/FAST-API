I use google colab to do this project.And I refer google and pdf that codetech it solutions provide.
This project predicts house prices in California using a RandomForestRegressor model on the California Housing dataset. The dataset, containing features like average income and house age, is loaded, processed, and split into training and test sets. A scikit-learn Pipeline is used, including standardization with StandardScaler and model training with RandomForestRegressor. The trained model is saved using pickle for easy reuse. A Flask web application is deployed to expose the model as an API, allowing users to send POST requests with feature data and receive predicted house prices in response, making it ready for real-time predictions.
